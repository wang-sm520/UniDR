# Architecture

`unisim-core` owns the public physics contract, backend capabilities, adapter
factory boundary, engine-native resources, conformance checks, and the reserved
benchmark case/result schemas. It has no dependency on UniLab, Hydra, Torch,
Gymnasium, learner, runner, or task code.

UniLab owns task/env/manager lifecycle, Hydra owner YAML, robot assets,
training, checkpoint, and sim2sim policy I/O. UniLab translates task-owned
scene and randomization inputs into the UniSim contract.

The MuJoCo adapter is constructed with a package-neutral `SceneCfg` and an
optional vectorized environment count. XML is parsed only during construction;
state/control arrays are copied through the public contract and engine objects
never escape the adapter. Drake, MJWarp and Genesis expose the same boundary
through concrete engine adapters. IsaacGym and IsaacSim share the subprocess IPC
framing and keep their Python 3.8/Kit workers outside the core wheel.

`unisim.ADAPTER_SPECS` is the single migration manifest for all eight UniLab
backend identities. ``available`` means a public adapter and diagnostics exist;
it does not claim that a proprietary SDK or GPU runtime is installed on every
host. Runtime support is established by the adapter's optional-extra and
worker smoke tests.

All asset and model metadata resolution is a cold-path concern. Hot-path
`step`/`reset` code receives validated arrays and cached identifiers; adapters
must not probe private engine attributes dynamically.

Interval domain randomization is declarative: UniLab's manager builds
`IntervalRandomizationPlan.ops` from `IntervalTermOp` descriptors defined in
`unisim.dr.interval` (term name, NumPy payload, optional body ids; stdlib +
NumPy only so plans stay pickle-safe across spawn-based collector processes).
Each backend owns its capability declaration (`supported_interval_terms`) and
a cold-path-built `_interval_term_handlers()` table; the generic
`SimBackend.apply_interval_randomization` dispatch validates each op against
the builtin term specs, routes it to the matching handler, and fails closed
with `NotImplementedError` for any term a backend does not declare. Custom
terms are free-form strings owned by the registering backend and validated
only against its capability set.

Reset-time model-field writes use the curated fields on
`ResetRandomizationPayload`; callers never submit compiler-derived fields such
as geometry bounds independently. Adapters expose authoritative defaults through
`SimBackend.get_reset_term_default(term)`: a canonical table for a single-model
backend or a per-environment table when fixed variants establish different
baselines.

Fixed model identity is separate from reset randomization. A task carries
`FixedVariantPlan` on `SceneCfg` so engine adapters realize it during
construction, before their first forward and before CUDA graph capture. The
plan contains final
read-only assignment rows, complete materialized `ModelSourceDescriptor`
entries, and a public layout guarantee (`same_layout` or
`uniform_public_layout`). Domain
randomization capabilities advertise the layouts an adapter can realize, as
well as whether playback exposes a per-env model. The plan and
capability objects use only stdlib and NumPy types, so they remain pickle-safe;
live `MjSpec`, mjbatch, and Warp objects never cross this boundary. Slot
merging, mesh/material pooling, per-world arrays, derived-field recomputation,
and playback representation are adapter-owned implementation details.

The MuJoCo adapter realizes that contract without reintroducing one full model
per environment. On the cold path it independently compiles each materialized
MJCF as a numerical/default oracle, validates same or uniform public layout,
and delegates canonical mesh pooling to mjbatch's `VariantPack`. The adapter
retains the canonical executor model, compiler-derived variant rows, compact
default tables, and immutable assignment—not one compiled `MjModel` per variant.
Runtime reset writes use the same expanded model-field views as canonical
mode. Same-layout mesh-geom slots may be disabled per world; changes to public
state/control topology fail closed. Playback compiles a detached visual oracle
on demand from the selected source, and offline playback saves one self-contained
model per rendered environment.

The MJWarp adapter realizes that plan during construction. It compiles every
MJCF source independently for oracle values, validates the declared layout,
pools meshes/materials into one canonical model, and installs per-world
`geom_dataid`, `geom_matid`, and mesh-dependent model fields after `put_model`
but before the first forward and CUDA-graph capture. Reset mirrors and
`get_reset_term_default()` therefore start from each world's assigned variant.
