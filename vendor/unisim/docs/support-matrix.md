The base wheel imports none of these SDKs. Construction performs cold-path
runtime discovery and raises an adapter-specific, actionable error when the
runtime is unavailable. The matrix is an adapter/API support statement, not a
claim that every host has every vendor SDK or GPU capability.

Self-collision can be selected at construction with
`create_backend("motrix", ..., motrix_disable_self_collision=True)` or
`create_backend("genesis", ..., genesis_enable_self_collision=False)`.
The Motrix option disables internal contacts for the articulation whose root is
`base_name`; a missing or ambiguous root fails before model construction.
Genesis disables contacts between links sharing an articulation root, including
when the robot and floor are imported from one MJCF. Robot-ground and contacts
with other articulation roots remain enabled. Both options accept a boolean or
`None`; unset/`None` retains historical behavior. IsaacGym and IsaacSim already
disable robot self-collision in their worker import paths. These options do not
change MuJoCo contacts.

The MuJoCo adapter's native executor is
[mjbatch](https://github.com/unilabsim/mjbatch), a maintained fork of
kevinzakka/mjbatch with prebuilt wheels for Linux x86_64/aarch64 and macOS
(CPython 3.10–3.14t) and an exact `mujoco==3.11.0` pin. Windows and musllinux
are unsupported for the native executor, so the Windows CI job runs the
core/import-boundary subset only. Numerical results before and after the
switch from the previous executor are not guaranteed identical — drift is
characterized by a recorded baseline, not gated. The MuJoCo adapter supports
construction-time `FixedVariantPlan` catalogs with `same_layout` and
`uniform_public_layout` guarantees. Same-layout variants and optional named
mesh-geom slots are merged into one canonical mjbatch executor through
`VariantPack`; heterogeneous public topology fails closed. Reset model-field
writes and per-world compiler defaults go through mjbatch `expand`/`set_const`,
and playback exposes a per-env independently compiled visual oracle. MJWarp
realizes construction-time same-layout and uniform-public-layout variants by
pooling assets in one canonical model and installing fixed per-world model rows
before CUDA graph capture. `chunk_size`/`adaptive_chunk_size` are deprecated and
ignored (warn-and-ignore); the chunk scheduler was removed and mjbatch's
work-stealing thread pool is the tuning mechanism.

The MuJoCo-related extras share one version line (MuJoCo 3.11 / MuJoCo-Warp
3.11 / warp-lang 1.16.0) and are jointly installable: `mjwarp` tracks the line
with `mujoco-warp~=3.11.0`, while `newton` keeps exact upstream-coupled pins
(`newton==1.5.1`, `mujoco-warp==3.11.0`, `mujoco==3.11.0`,
`warp-lang==1.16.0`). Run
`uv run scripts/check_newton_runtime.py` after installation for a metadata-only
probe; add `--import` when the native runtime should be imported explicitly.
The adapter's cold-path calibration samples solver counts and raises an explicit
capacity error when `nconmax` or `njmax` is too small; it never accepts silent
constraint truncation.

Newton playback renders natively through `ViewerGL` (`pyglet>=2.1.6,<3`,
`imgui-bundle>=1.92.0`) when installed with the single `newton` extra:
`record` renders offscreen, `interactive` opens the windowed viewer, and
`auto` picks by display availability. If a runtime is incomplete, `record`
falls back to the offline MuJoCo snapshot pipeline and `interactive` fails
closed with an actionable error. Headless offscreen GL needs EGL
(`PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl`) or GLX under Wayland.
