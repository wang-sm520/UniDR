# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Coalesce IsaacGym root/DOF tensor resets before the next physics step and
  refresh only after simulation, respecting the SDK's GPU setter ordering
  and index-tensor lifetime rules. Repeated G1 mass resets remain finite.
- Keep IsaacGym PhysX on the selected GPU but use CPU state tensors: Preview
  4 runtime mass writes corrupt subsequent root resets with the GPU tensor
  pipeline. Native G1 grounded/airborne contacts and mass-reset trajectories
  now pass; full-scale throughput remains unmeasured.
- Apply Genesis absolute reset randomization before rebuilding forward
  kinematics and mass-dependent COM/spatial-inertia caches, so the first
  post-reset step does not use the previous mass configuration.
- Clear IsaacLab simulation callbacks and its singleton before closing the
  Kit stage, preventing headless shutdown from entering the STOP callback's
  render loop. Native readback probes now reuse adapter runtime discovery
  and worker library environments.
- Implement M1 selected-environment IsaacGym and IsaacSim reset randomization
  for absolute `body_mass`, `kp`, and `kd` payloads. Cache nominal native
  metadata and importer name mappings at materialization, preserve inertia,
  and leave unselected rows and omitted terms unchanged. `get_body_mass()`
  exposes a detached nominal table; capability queries negotiate with the
  worker before advertising support.
- Upgrade the shared Python-3.8-compatible subprocess wire protocol to version
  2 with mass/gain shared-memory reset slots and mandatory version/capability
  metadata. Old or incomplete workers fail closed. Native randomized-reset
  failures invalidate the worker because SDK writes cannot be rolled back.
- Replace IsaacSim's placeholder contact-force slot with IsaacLab
  `ContactSensor` reporting, mapped by link names. Host contact sensors require
  the matching reporter handshake. Selected reset rows stay clear until a
  physics step publishes fresh contact data.
- Add NumPy-only worker/IPC regression tests and opt-in native property
  readback tests. Native G1 physics-effect acceptance remains separate and is
  not claimed on hosts with unavailable GPUs; see
  [the Isaac reset contract](docs/isaac-reset-contract.md).

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-10

- Promote the current contract and adapter surface to the `1.2.x` line. No
  functional changes since 1.1.6; the public import boundary
  (`SimBackend`, `create_backend`, `ADAPTER_SPECS`, adapter classes, and
  `unisim.backend.subprocess_ipc`) is unchanged.

## 1.1.6 - 2026-09-10

- **Fix:** SuperDex serial-mode native interactive playback now frames the
  scene (`viewer.frame_scene()`) immediately after `set_scene`, before the
  first `frame_tick`. Polyscope's camera view matrix is uninitialized (NaN)
  until the first explicit camera placement, and the viewer's navigation
  gizmo reads it while building the first ImGui frame, so on-screen
  interactive playback crashed on the first frame with `ValueError: cannot
  convert float NaN to integer` (UniLab `eval --sim superdex --render-mode
  interactive`).

## 1.1.5 - 2026-09-10

- **Breaking (snapshot layout):** `mjwarp` `get_physics_state` snapshots now
  append `[mocap_pos(nmocap*3), mocap_quat(nmocap*4)]` after
  `[time, qpos, qvel]` when the model has mocap bodies, and
  `run_playback_mode` declares the extended `snapshot_shape`. The offline
  render workers (`render_many`) replay the recorded mocap pose instead of
  resetting mocap bodies to the model defaults, fixing record-mode videos
  where mocap-driven geometry (e.g. the Wuji mocap palm, whose wrist pitch is
  randomized at reset) rendered misaligned with — and interpenetrating — the
  free-joint objects. Legacy `[time, qpos, qvel]` snapshots keep the previous
  defaults-plus-grid-offset fallback. `validate_offline_visual_model` now also
  requires `nmocap` parity between the physics and visual models.

- **Fix:** `ghost_geom` debug overlays now inherit the material (with mesh UV
  texturing) of the model geom that renders the same mesh, in both the
  offline render workers and the mjwarp interactive viewer, matching the
  source task's textured goal indicator. `append_debug_primitives` gains an
  optional `mesh_materials` mapping; assets without a textured model geom
  keep the flat primitive rgba.

- **Fix:** multi-env grid recording without an explicit `cam_lookat` widens
  `cam_distance` so every grid cell fits the frame (`render_many`
  `_grid_fit_distance`, from the grid span, fovy, and frame aspect ratio).
  An explicit `cam_lookat` still pins the camera to a single env.
- Add a SuperDex `execution_mode` option (`superdex_execution_mode` factory
  kwarg, `"batch"` default or `"serial"`). Serial mode never constructs the
  `SceneBatchExecutor` and steps every scene on the environment thread so the
  native SuperDex debugger can attach without violating the scene's
  thread-affine `DebugDraw`. Batch mode now fails closed with an actionable
  `RuntimeError` naming the serial mode when a debugger client is connected at
  construction or attaches before a later step (unilabsim/unisim#55). Serial
  mode also enables native interactive playback: `run_playback` in the
  `interactive` render mode drives the upstream Polyscope viewer on the single
  environment scene, failing closed unless the backend is serial with
  `num_envs=1`.

- Switch the SuperDex adapter's optional runtime to the temporary unilabsim
  `superdex-physics-uni` / `superdex-robotics-uni` 1.0.0 wheels, which carry
  the native batch executor ahead of the upstream project_superdex release,
  and extend the supported interpreter range to CPython 3.12 and 3.13. The
  adapter still rejects other Python versions with a targeted diagnostic.
  Switch the distribution names back to upstream once the upstream PR merges.
  Map unlimited actuator force ranges to the dtype's finite bounds so the
  native `step_control` validation accepts MJCF motors without a `forcerange`.

- **Fix:** multi-env grid rendering in `render_many.render_frame_job` now
  translates mocap bodies with the environment. Worker `MjData` is reused
  across frames, so `init_worker` caches cold-path `mocap_pos` defaults and
  `set_state` resets from them before adding the grid offset; mocap bodies
  are excluded from the legacy `geom_xpos`/`site_xpos` post-shift so the two
  mechanisms cannot double the offset. Previously, models whose first body
  has a free joint (e.g. the Wuji in-hand scene: free-joint cube plus mocap
  palm) rendered every env's mocap-driven geometry stacked at env 0,
  misaligned with both the free-joint objects and the debug overlay
  primitives, which already receive the offset exactly once
  (unilabsim/wuji_unilab#21).

- **Breaking:** replace `run_playback(..., extra_data_getter=...)` with
  `debug_overlay_getter`. The new callback returns per-frame, per-env
  sequences of typed `DebugPrimitive` values (`sphere`, `box`, `frame`,
  `arrow`, `ghost_geom`, `text`) with env-local poses instead of a single
  `(num_envs, 3)` marker-position array; grid offsets are applied by the
  renderer. `BackendPlayCapabilities` gains `supports_debug_overlay`; the
  MuJoCo-family offline snapshot pipeline (mujoco, mjwarp, drake, newton,
  superdex) advertises it, while other backends fail closed with
  `NotImplementedError` when a getter is supplied. `ghost_geom` primitives
  resolve `mesh_asset` against playback-model mesh names or mesh asset files
  injected into the render model; `text` primitives are a documented no-op on
  the MuJoCo off-screen path. Newton record playback with overlays routes to
  the offline MuJoCo snapshot renderer (the native ViewerGL path cannot
  inject user geoms).
- mjwarp interactive playback now consumes `debug_overlay_getter`: each frame
  injects the tracked world's primitives into the passive viewer's
  `user_scn` before `sync()`, resolving `ghost_geom` meshes against the
  playback model (fail-closed when unregistered). `BackendPlayCapabilities`
  gains `supports_interactive_debug_overlay` (default False; mjwarp reports
  True) so callers can tell whether the interactive path consumes the getter.
  The interactive `on_frame` hook remains fail-closed
  (unilabsim/wuji_unilab#21).
- **Breaking:** `camera_kwargs` is normalized into the typed frozen
  `CameraCfg` at the `run_playback`/`init_renderer` boundary. Unknown keys —
  including the historical `distance`/`elevation_deg`/`azimuth_deg` aliases —
  now raise an error naming them instead of being silently ignored; the
  optional `cam_fov` key is supported by the MuJoCo offline renderer and
  Genesis. `DebugPrimitive`, `DebugOverlayGetter`, `CameraCfg`, and
  `validate_debug_overlays` are exported from `unisim` and
  `unisim.contract` (unilabsim/wuji_unilab#21).

- Add `unisim.visualization.render_many.append_debug_primitives`, the public
  primitive-injection entry shared by the offline render workers and
  interactive viewers (single-env `viewer.user_scn` callers pass
  `overlays=[primitives]`, `offsets=None`); it returns the injected geom
  count. Interactive `ghost_geom` meshes must already be registered in the
  loaded model (resolved via `mesh_ids`), failing closed otherwise — the
  interactive path cannot recompile the model (unilabsim/wuji_unilab#21).

- Add `run_playback(..., on_frame=...)`: the offline MuJoCo pipeline calls
  `on_frame(frame_index, frame)` with each `(H, W, 3)` uint8 frame before
  video encoding; returning a replacement array (same shape/dtype, validated
  fail-closed) substitutes it and `None` keeps the original. Backends on
  native renderers (motrix, genesis, subprocess IPC; newton/mjwarp
  interactive paths) fail closed with `NotImplementedError`; newton record
  playback with `on_frame` routes to the offline snapshot renderer
  (unilabsim/wuji_unilab#21).


- Add a local-source SuperDex `SceneBatchExecutor` integration: a persistent
  C++ CPU barrier batches independent-scene generalized force writes, stepping,
  and articulated state reads. `superdex_num_workers=0` resolves an
  affinity-aware outer worker count while SDK-internal and outer workers remain
  mutually exclusive.

- Batch SuperDex body and sensor frame transforms over selected environments,
  removing repeated small-array work while preserving native stepping order,
  controls, sensor precision and reset isolation.

- Add the optional SuperDex 1.0.0 CPU adapter with native fixed-base bot and
  audited MJCF articulation materialization, NumPy state/control translation,
  independent scene resets, named state/contact sensors and process-owned
  cleanup. Python 3.12 is required by the upstream wheels. See
  `docs/superdex.md` for the experimental contact profile and explicit limits.

## 1.1.4 - 2026-09-08

- Add cold-bound selected-world mocap pose reads/writes and reset ordering to
  `SimBackend`, with an explicit unsupported default and a MJWarp implementation.
- Add MJWarp reset randomization for primitive geometry size (including derived
  bounds), contact solref/solimp, joint damping and joint friction loss. New
  payload tables validate before mutation, preserve unselected worlds, and
  expose cold-path defaults through the public backend contract. See
  [the owner contract](docs/mocap-reset-contract.md) and issue #40.
- Preserve position actuator gain signs in MJWarp domain randomization.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-09-06

- Ensure Newton ViewerGL playback shows authored static planes and supplies a
  default visual-only floor when a scene does not define one.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-09-06

- Merge Newton's native ViewerGL dependencies (`pyglet` and `imgui-bundle`)
  into the single `newton` extra. Newton playback now uses its native renderer
  by default after `uv sync --extra newton`; the separate `newton-render`
  extra is removed.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-06

- Align all MuJoCo-related extras on the 3.11 line (unilabsim/UniLab#1515,
  unilabsim/unisim#34): the `mujoco` extra now requires `mujoco~=3.11.0` with
  `mujoco-uni-runtime==0.5.0` (exact pin — one runtime release carries one
  prebuilt MuJoCo binding, so a lock bump is gated on wheel availability); the
  `mjwarp` extra moves from `mujoco-warp==3.10.0.3` to `mujoco-warp~=3.11.0`
  with `warp-lang==1.16.0`; and the `newton` extra keeps its exact pins.
  The extras are now jointly resolvable, so the `[tool.uv]` extra conflicts
  are removed and the MJWarp runtime check accepts the whole
  `mujoco-warp` 3.11 line instead of one exact version.
- Add snapshot playback support to the Newton adapter: `get_physics_state` /
  `set_physics_state` ([time, qpos, qvel] host-cache layout), record/none
  `resolve_play_render_plan` semantics, and `run_playback` through the shared
  offline MuJoCo snapshot renderer now in `unisim.backend.playback_common`
  (mjwarp behavior and messages unchanged). Add a fail-closed
  `SimBackend.set_physics_state` default.
- Add MJCF contact-sensor (`mjSENS_CONTACT`) support to the Newton adapter for
  the exact `data="found" num=1` named-geom-pair shape: per-env binary flags
  are resolved once against `SolverMuJoCo.mjc_geom_to_newton_shape` at
  materialization and refreshed through `SolverMuJoCo.update_contacts`; all
  other contact-sensor configurations remain fail-closed.
- Rework the README around the project overview, UniLab relationship,
  installation, and quick start, and add the Chinese `README_zh.md`.
- Add the Newton 1.5.1 runtime extra and a metadata/import probe on the
  MuJoCo-Warp 3.11 line (the 3.11 alignment above later lifted the initial
  mutual exclusion with the `mjwarp` extra).
- Add fail-closed Newton nconmax/njmax capacity sampling and overflow
  diagnostics for the forthcoming adapter.
- Add the Newton `SimBackend` adapter with explicit CUDA placement, cold-path
  MJCF materialization/audits, host NumPy state caches, and fail-closed sensor
  and geometry coverage.
- Fixed Genesis device selection on multi-GPU hosts: the engine only honors
  the first entry of `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, so the adapter now pins
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the requested physical device before any CUDA
  query (including `torch.cuda.is_available()`, which itself latches the
  visible-device set) and remaps the process-local device index to `cuda:0`.
  Out-of-range requests fail closed with a clear error.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-05

- Added the declarative interval domain-randomization term contract in
  `unisim.dr.interval`: builtin term specs (`INTERVAL_TERM_SPECS`,
  `interval_term_spec`), the pickle-safe `IntervalTermOp` descriptor with
  builtin-contract validation, and the `ops` field on
  `IntervalRandomizationPlan` (`iter_ops()` translates the legacy fields).
- Added the `supported_interval_terms` capability set on
  `DomainRandomizationCapabilities` with `supports_interval_term()` /
  `get_unsupported_interval_terms()`, falling back to the legacy bools so old
  constructor call sites keep their meaning.
- Replaced the abstract per-backend `apply_interval_randomization`
  implementations with generic `SimBackend` dispatch over the backend-owned
  `_interval_term_handlers()` table; terms without a handler fail closed with
  `NotImplementedError` naming the backend class and the term.
- Deprecated the five legacy `IntervalRandomizationPlan` fields and the five
  `supports_interval_*` capability bools; they remain functional and will be
  removed in the next major release.
- Fixed the mjwarp and genesis backends silently dropping unsupported
  interval body-torque and body-angular-velocity randomization; both now fail
  closed through the base dispatch.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-04

- Promote the contract and seven-adapter manifest to the stable `1.0.x` line;
  the public import boundary (`SimBackend`, `create_backend`, `ADAPTER_SPECS`,
  adapter classes, and `unisim.backend.subprocess_ipc`) is now stable.
- Support `SimBackend.set_pre_step_control` on the `mjwarp` backend: a
  registered converter now runs on the host before every physics substep with
  the qpos/qvel cache refreshed to the substep-start state (matching the
  MuJoCo backend's substep boundary and `callback_sensordata=False` sensor
  semantics), and `None` unregisters it.  The callback path uses eager kernel
  launches instead of captured step graphs.
- Restore the missing 0.1.10 changelog entry and the 0.1.4/0.1.5 ordering, and
  correct the `unisim.backend.subprocess_ipc` path and Isaac extras spelling in
  the migration and support-matrix documentation.

## 0.1.14 - 2026-09-02

- Update the trusted-publishing action to support the source distribution's
  current Python Core Metadata version.
- Require successful cross-platform tests and pre-release sdist verification
  before a version tag can publish to PyPI.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-09-02

- Add GitHub Actions CI and tag-triggered PyPI trusted publishing.
- Publish only the source distribution so releases do not select a Python
  version, operating system, or wheel platform.
- Document repository development, compatibility, and release conventions.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-09-02

- Fix the root public export surface so wildcard imports resolve
  `MjcfSubprocessBackend` and its historical `SubprocessBackend` alias.
- Use package-owned `UNISIM_*` worker/cache environment variables and
  `~/.cache/unisim` defaults, with read-only fallback to legacy `UNILAB_*`
  overrides.
- Expand adapter/factory/import-boundary tests for the complete seven-backend
  manifest and package isolation.

## 0.1.11

- Corrected the Drake adapter to consume the external `drake-uni` distribution
  through its `drake_uni` import namespace.
- Added fail-closed import diagnostics and support-matrix documentation for the
  standalone Drake runtime boundary.

## 0.1.10

- Replaced the `drake` PyPI dependency with the external `drake-uni==0.1.0`
  distribution and aligned the Drake adapter with its batch runtime API.

## 0.1.9

- Added the MuJoCo batch runtime to the `mujoco` optional extra so the
  production adapter is installable from a clean UniSim environment.
- Made conformance checks exercise adapters through their cold-path
  `materialize()` lifecycle before stepping.
- Expanded standalone MuJoCo and Motrix adapter tests to cover full state
  shapes and identity-quaternion reset semantics.

## 0.1.8

- Kept playback video I/O monkeypatchable while preserving lazy optional
  ``imageio`` loading for import isolation.

## 0.1.7

- Corrected factory option translation for the extracted backend adapters.
- Preserved backend-specific validation and fail-closed diagnostics when
  callers pass options from the UniLab owner layer.

## 0.1.6

- Migrated the complete production backend implementations and shared
  subprocess IPC into `unisim-core`.
- Removed the test-only runtime bridge from the public factory so every named
  backend resolves to its concrete adapter and fails closed when unavailable.
- Added support-matrix, migration, and package-boundary documentation for all
  seven adapters.

## 0.1.5

- Exported adapter-specific dependency diagnostics and the shared subprocess
  backend types from the public `unisim` namespace.

## 0.1.4

- Added public Drake, MJWarp, Genesis, IsaacGym and IsaacSim adapter boundaries.
- Added shared subprocess IPC framing used by Isaac worker integrations.
- Promoted all seven UniLab backend identities to the adapter manifest; SDK
  availability remains lazy and fail-closed.

## 0.1.3

- Add the staged adapter identity manifest for all roadmap backends.

## 0.1.2

- Add the lazy Motrix adapter and shared contract smoke coverage.

## 0.1.1

- Add the lazy MuJoCo adapter and backend factory.
- Add MuJoCo contract smoke coverage and adapter documentation.

## 0.1.0

- Bootstrap the `unisim` namespace and `unisim-core` distribution.
- Add the backend-neutral `SimBackend` contract, fake backend, and conformance helper.
- Reserve benchmark case/result interfaces without implementing workloads or measurements.
