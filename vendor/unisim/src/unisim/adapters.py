"""Adapter metadata shared by package tooling and future benchmark clients.

The manifest is intentionally descriptive. It does not claim runtime support;
an adapter is promoted only when its implementation and conformance child are
merged. Keeping identities here prevents benchmark and UniLab registries from
inventing divergent backend names during the staged migration.
