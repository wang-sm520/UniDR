Reinforcement learning algorithms and asynchronous runtimes extracted from
[UniLab](https://github.com/unilabsim/UniLab), packaged as a standalone,
simulator-agnostic library.

- Distribution name: `unilab-rl`
- Import namespace: `uni_rl`
- Repository: [unilabsim/unilab_rl](https://github.com/unilabsim/unilab_rl)

## Relationship with UniLab

`uni_rl` is the RL algorithm and async-runtime layer of the UniLab project,
split out into its own package. [UniLab](https://github.com/unilabsim/UniLab)
remains the consumer side: it owns the physics backends, task suites, and
training entrypoints, and injects environments into `uni_rl` through
`uni_rl.env_contract.EnvFactory`. `uni_rl` never imports `unilab` / `unisim`
and never constructs environments itself, so any vectorized environment
satisfying the contract — including simulators outside UniLab — can drive the
algorithms in this package.

If you train with UniLab you already get `uni_rl` transitively. Install
`unilab-rl` directly when you want to reuse its algorithms and async runtime
with your own environment stack.

> Naming note: the originally intended distribution name `uni-rl` is
> unregistrable on PyPI because it ultranormalizes to the existing `unirl`
> project. The distribution is therefore published as `unilab-rl`; the import
> namespace remains `uni_rl` as designed.

## Contents

- **On-policy**: PPO via [rsl_rl](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl)
  (`FinalObservationAwarePPO`, `RslRlVecEnvWrapper`)
- **Async PPO (APPO)**: native collector/learner multiprocess implementation
- **Off-policy**: FastSAC, FastTD3, and FlashSAC with double-buffer async runners
- **Runtime infrastructure**: shared-memory rollout/replay buffers, replay
  pipelines, data-parallel gradient sync, memory budgeting, tensorboard/wandb
  training loggers, and a trace recorder

## Layout

- `uni_rl.algos.*` — the algorithm layer: on-policy (`rsl_rl` PPO wrappers),
  async on-policy (`appo`), off-policy learners (`fast_sac`, `fast_td3`,
  `flash_sac`), and shared algorithm helpers (`common`)
- `uni_rl.ipc` — runtime infrastructure: async runner, shared-memory
  rollout/replay buffers, replay pipelines, DP gradient sync, memory budget
- `uni_rl.offpolicy` — the generic off-policy double-buffer runner scaffolding
- `uni_rl.logging` — tensorboard/wandb training loggers, trace recorder
- `uni_rl.utils` — device, seed, nan-guard, observation helpers
- `uni_rl.env_contract` — the injected env factory/protocol contract

## Installation

```bash
pip install unilab-rl
# or, with uv:
uv add unilab-rl
```

Requires Python 3.10–3.13 and PyTorch ≥ 2.7.

## Usage

`uni_rl` does not construct environments. Inject a picklable env factory
(`EnvFactory = Callable[[int, Mapping | None], EnvProtocol]`) into the runner
of your chosen algorithm:

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping

from uni_rl.env_contract import EnvProtocol


def make_env(num_envs: int, cfg: Mapping | None) -> EnvProtocol:
    """Top-level factory (picklable by reference; no closures/lambdas)."""
    ...
```

The env contract is a minimal numpy-based, autoresetting vectorized-env
protocol: dict observations keyed by observation group (`obs_groups_spec`),
`step()` with final-observation semantics, and `reset()` returning
`(obs, info)`. See the module docstring in
[`src/uni_rl/env_contract.py`](src/uni_rl/env_contract.py) for the full
contract, and the *new algorithm recipe* section in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for how to plug in a custom algorithm via
`runtime_resolver` without forking.

### PPO curriculum checkpoint state

An optional `RslRlPPORuntime.runner_cls` lets an entrypoint select a custom
runner alongside its wrapper. `None` keeps the entrypoint's existing standard
runner; older wrapper-only resolvers continue to work.

For training that must restore curriculum progress, select
`uni_rl.algos.rsl_rl_training_state.TrainingStateOnPolicyRunner`. Its wrapper
must implement the explicit `uni_rl.training_state.TrainingStateProvider`
protocol, or the caller must pass `training_state_provider=` to the runner:

```python
def export_training_state(self) -> Mapping[str, object]:
    return {"schema": "my-task-v1", "steps": self.steps, "difficulty": self.difficulty}


def import_training_state(self, state: Mapping[str, object]) -> None:
    # Validate the complete owner schema before changing any state.
    ...
```

The runner stores a version-1 envelope in
`checkpoint["infos"]["uni_rl_training_state"]`; the payload is plain JSON data
and the provider owns its schema/version. Arrays must be converted explicitly
to lists. The runner never discovers a nested environment or serializes owner
objects. Existing algorithm, optimizer, iteration, and logger behavior stays in
the parent runner.

`load()` requires valid training state by default. Only an explicit actor-only
`load_cfg={"actor": True}` may use `restore_training_state=False` for a legacy checkpoint. Envelope
errors are rejected before algorithm loading; provider import errors propagate
and must abort resume. Loading the algorithm and provider is not a transactional
rollback. This contract covers training progress, not physics or RNG snapshots.

The runner is independent of any particular task or simulator. The downstream
provider must restore its own counters and adaptive curriculum state together;
restoring a derived counter alone is insufficient if the next step recomputes it.

## Design contract

`uni_rl` does **not** depend on any simulator or environment library.
Algorithm behavior is owned by the algo modules under `uni_rl.algos.*`;
runtime infrastructure (`ipc`, `logging`, `offpolicy`, `utils`,
`env_contract`) lives at the top level and never depends on the algorithm
layer. See UniLab's training entrypoints for reference env integrations.

## Development

```bash
make sync      # install dependencies (uv)
make test      # pytest
make format    # ruff check --fix + ruff format
uv run mypy src/uni_rl && uv run pyright   # type gates
```
