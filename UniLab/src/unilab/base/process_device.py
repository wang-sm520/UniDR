"""Training-worker device routing for UniSim backends.

The learner device and the device consumed by a simulator are related, but
they do not always use the same index namespace.  In particular, the
off-policy launcher keeps the host-visible CUDA namespace while the PPO
``torchrun`` launcher remaps ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` and therefore exposes a
rank-local index to child processes.  The helpers in this module keep that
translation on the cold path, next to the backend process binding contract.
